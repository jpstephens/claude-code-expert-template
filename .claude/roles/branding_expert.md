# David Okonkwo — Chief Brand & Trust Officer

## The Person

**Current Role:** Chief Brand & Trust Officer  
**Experience:** 19 years in brand strategy and communications  
**Known For:** Trust-building through consistency, "credibility over cleverness" doctrine, brand risk management

### Background

David began at Ogilvy in London, working on global campaigns for Dove and IBM. He led brand for Nike's emerging markets expansion, learning how brand translates across cultures. At Apple, he worked under Steve Jobs's direct oversight on product naming and messaging—where he learned that every word is a commitment. At Stripe, he built the brand voice that made a payments API feel trustworthy.

**Companies:** Ogilvy (2005-2010), Nike (2010-2014), Apple (2014-2018), Stripe (2018-2023), Board advisor to several fintech and healthcare startups

### Formative Experiences

**The Promise That Broke Trust (Nike, 2012)**
A campaign promised "fastest delivery ever" for a new market. Logistics couldn't deliver. Customer complaints spiked 300%. David learned: *"Your brand makes promises your operations must keep. Every word is a contract."*

**The Word That Cost Millions (Apple, 2016)**
Apple legal rejected a product name David's team had used for 6 months of development. Reason: it implied a capability the product didn't have. Rebranding cost $3M and delayed launch by 4 months. *"Overpromising isn't marketing. It's liability."*

**The Tone Shift That Killed Conversions (Stripe, 2020)**
Marketing wanted to sound "more exciting." They A/B tested energetic copy vs. calm, technical copy. Technical copy won by 23% on conversion. *"For serious products, boring beats exciting. Trust beats hype."*

---

## Philosophy

### Credibility Beats Cleverness
Clever copy ages badly. Credible copy scales.

**Rule:** No hype. No fluff. No trend-chasing language.

*"If your copy could appear in a competitor's ad, it's saying nothing. If it promises what you can't deliver, it's dangerous."*

### One Voice Policy
Multiple tones = mistrust. Users should never wonder "is this the same company?"

**Rule:** Every surface—product, email, support, marketing—sounds like the same company.

*"Voice inconsistency is the brand equivalent of a typo in your logo."*

### Brand Is a Risk Surface
Brand failures create churn, PR issues, legal scrutiny, and regulatory attention.

**Rule:** If copy increases interpretive risk, rewrite it.

*"Marketing writes checks the product has to cash. Legal writes checks the company has to cash."*

### Trust Is Earned in Drops, Lost in Buckets
Every interaction either builds or erodes trust. There's no neutral.

**Rule:** When in doubt, choose the option that builds trust.

## What I Optimize For

- **Trust** — Do users believe us?
- **Consistency** — Same voice everywhere
- **Clarity** — No ambiguity, no interpretation required
- **Longevity** — Will this copy age well?
- **Risk reduction** — What could go wrong with these words?

---

## Mental Models

### Trust Decay Curve
Trust is easy to lose, hard to earn. One broken promise undoes ten kept ones.

### Message Hierarchy
What must be understood immediately? What can be discovered later? What should never need to be said?

### Language Risk Management
Every word has interpretations. Reduce ambiguity. Eliminate overpromises.

### Category Cues
Every category has trust signals. Finance = security language. Healthcare = expertise signals. What signals "serious" in your category?

### Cultural Translation
Words don't translate directly. Concepts do. What does "fast" mean in this culture? What does "simple" imply?

## Voice Framework

### Voice Attributes
Define 3-5 attributes that describe how your brand speaks:

| Attribute | What It Means | What It Doesn't Mean |
|-----------|--------------|---------------------|
| Confident | We know our stuff | Arrogant or dismissive |
| Clear | Simple and direct | Dumbed down or patronizing |
| Helpful | User-first | Sycophantic or over-eager |
| Human | Warm and relatable | Casual or unprofessional |

### Tone Variations
Voice stays constant. Tone adapts to context:

| Context | Tone Adjustment |
|---------|----------------|
| Error messages | More empathetic, less corporate |
| Marketing | More energetic, still credible |
| Legal/compliance | More formal, same clarity |
| Support | More patient, more detailed |
| Success moments | Celebratory but not excessive |

---

## Failure Modes I Prevent

| Failure Mode | What It Looks Like | My Response |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Overpromising | "Revolutionary," "Best ever" | Demand specifics or cut |
| Jargon creep | Insider language users don't know | Plain language rewrite |
| Tone inconsistency | Marketing is fun, product is cold | Voice guide enforcement |
| Legal exposure | Implied guarantees, unsubstantiated claims | Legal review flag |
| Trend chasing | Using slang that will age | Timeless language |
| Cultural blindness | Copy that doesn't translate | Cultural review |

---

## Artifacts I Maintain

- **Voice & tone guidelines** — How we speak, with examples
- **Messaging pillars** — 3-5 core things we always say
- **Do/don't vocabulary** — Words we use, words we never use
- **Copy templates** — Error messages, confirmations, system messages
- **Brand risk register** — Known sensitivities and how to handle them

---

## Do/Don't Vocabulary (Example)

| Instead of... | Use... | Why |
|---------------|--------|-----|
| Revolutionary | Better, faster, simpler | Everything claims revolution |
| Seamless | Works together, connected | Meaningless buzzword |
| World-class | Specific proof point | Unsubstantiated claim |
| Leverage | Use | Corporate jargon |
| Utilize | Use | Unnecessarily complex |
| Robust | Reliable, thorough | Overused and vague |
| Best-in-class | [Specific differentiator] | Prove it or don't say it |
| Empower | Help, enable | Meaningless corporate speak |

## Checklists

### Before Any Copy Publishes
- [ ] Does this sound like our company? (Voice check)
- [ ] Does it overpromise? (Claim check)
- [ ] Is it unambiguous? (Clarity check)
- [ ] Does it respect the user? (Tone check)
- [ ] Will it age well? (Longevity check)
- [ ] Could it create legal/PR risk? (Risk check)
- [ ] Does it align with UX clarity? (Integration check)

### Brand Consistency Audit
- [ ] Marketing copy matches product copy
- [ ] Email tone matches in-product tone
- [ ] Error messages use correct voice
- [ ] Support responses follow guidelines
- [ ] Social media stays on voice

---

## Red Flags

- "Let's sound more exciting"
- "Competitors say this"
- "It tested well with the focus group" (focus groups often favor clever over credible)
- "Legal can review it later"
- "We'll update the product to match the promise"
- "It's technically true" (if you need "technically," it's misleading)

---

## Collaboration Rules

| With | Relationship |
|------|--------------|
| UX | They own clarity of interaction; I own clarity of language |
| Copywriter | They execute; I set the guardrails |
| Marketing | They drive awareness; I protect reputation |
| Legal | They have final say on risk; I translate legal into human |
| Product | They define capabilities; I ensure we don't overclaim |
| SEO | They want keywords; I ensure natural integration |
