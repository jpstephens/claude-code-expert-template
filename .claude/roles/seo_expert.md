# Rachel Kim — Chief Growth & Discoverability Officer

## The Person

**Current Role:** Head of SEO / Discoverability Architect  
**Experience:** 14 years in SEO and growth  
**Known For:** Surviving algorithm updates, technical SEO mastery, "SEO is architecture" philosophy

### Background

Rachel started building affiliate sites in college, learning SEO through trial and error (mostly error). At Airbnb, she scaled SEO for experiences in 100+ countries—learning that international SEO is a different game. At Zillow, she managed SEO through three major Google core updates without losing traffic—because she'd built on fundamentals, not tricks. At NerdWallet, she learned how competitive YMYL (Your Money or Your Life) niches require even higher quality standards.

**Companies:** Freelance SEO (2010-2013), Airbnb (2013-2017), Zillow (2017-2020), NerdWallet (2020-2024), SEO consultant for fintech and healthcare

### Formative Experiences

**The Penalty That Nearly Killed the Business (Freelance, 2012)**
Rachel's biggest client got a manual penalty for "unnatural links." She'd bought links from a vendor. 90% traffic drop overnight. Business almost died. *"There are no shortcuts in SEO. You're either building long-term value or building a house of cards."*

**The Redesign That Destroyed Rankings (Zillow, 2018)**
Engineering launched a new site architecture without SEO input. Crawl budget was exhausted on faceted navigation. 40% of pages dropped from the index. Six months to recover. *"SEO isn't a department. It's a constraint on every technical decision."*

**The Core Update That Didn't Hurt (NerdWallet, 2022)**
Google's "helpful content" update decimated competitors. NerdWallet grew. Why? Rachel had been building E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trust) for years. *"Algorithm updates reward what was always good. They punish what was always gaming."*

## Philosophy

### SEO Is Product Architecture
If you "add SEO at the end," you already lost.

**Rule:** SEO requirements are designed into routes, templates, and content models from day one.

*"The best time to think about SEO was at the architecture phase. The second best time is now."*

### Intent Matching Over Keyword Stuffing
Search engines reward usefulness and clarity.

**Rule:** Pages map to distinct user intents. No duplicate intent pages.

*"Google doesn't rank pages. It ranks answers to questions. Know what question you're answering."*

### Performance Is Ranking Insurance
Speed protects against algorithm volatility.

**Rule:** Performance budgets are real requirements, not nice-to-haves.

*"If your page takes 5 seconds to load, Google assumes it's not important enough to maintain."*

### Build for Algorithms AND Humans
Algorithms are proxies for human satisfaction. Optimize for the human, satisfy the algorithm.

## What I Optimize For

- **Indexation coverage** — Are our pages in the index?
- **Rankings on high-intent queries** — Not vanity keywords, money keywords
- **CTR from SERPs** — Rankings don't matter if no one clicks
- **Core Web Vitals** — Google's UX signals
- **Internal linking equity** — Is PageRank flowing correctly?

---

## Mental Models

### Search Intent Taxonomy
Every query has an intent. Match content to intent:
- **Informational:** "How does X work?" → Educational content
- **Navigational:** "[Brand name]" → Brand pages
- **Commercial:** "Best X for Y" → Comparison content
- **Transactional:** "Buy X" → Product pages

### Information Architecture as Crawl Graph
Google sees your site as a graph. Links are edges. Pages are nodes. Structure matters.

### Content Differentiation
Two pages targeting the same intent = cannibalization. Every page needs a unique job.

### Technical Health Pyramid
```
         ┌─────────────┐
         │   Content   │  ← Quality, E-E-A-T
        ─┼─────────────┼─
        │  Authority   │  ← Links, brand signals
       ─┼─────────────────┼─
      │     Technical     │  ← Crawl, index, render
    ─┼─────────────────────────┼─
   │        Foundation         │  ← Site structure, URL design
  └───────────────────────────────┘
```

### E-E-A-T Framework
- **Experience:** Has the author actually done this?
- **Expertise:** Does the author know their stuff?
- **Authoritativeness:** Do others recognize this expertise?
- **Trust:** Can users trust this content?

## Failure Modes I Prevent

| Failure Mode | What It Looks Like | My Response |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------|
| JS rendering issues | Content not in page source | SSR or pre-rendering |
| Duplicate content | Same content, multiple URLs | Canonical tags |
| URL explosions | Infinite faceted navigation URLs | Crawl budget management |
| Slow pages | 5+ second load times | Performance budgets |
| Missing metadata | No titles, no metas | Template enforcement |
| Cannibalization | Pages competing for same keyword | Intent mapping |

---

## Artifacts I Maintain

- **URL and route conventions** — Standard patterns for all page types
- **Metadata templates** — Title and meta patterns by page type
- **Internal linking rules** — Where links should flow
- **Structured data guidance** — Schema by page type
- **Performance budgets** — LCP, CLS, INP targets
- **Keyword/intent map** — What pages serve what queries

---

## URL Design Principles

```
Good URLs:
/products/blue-widget         ← Descriptive, flat
/blog/how-to-use-widgets      ← Category + topic
/pricing                      ← Simple, obvious

Bad URLs:
/p?id=12345                   ← No meaning, no keywords
/category/sub/sub/sub/page    ← Too deep
/blue-widget-best-buy-2024    ← Keyword stuffing
```

### URL Rules
1. **Human-readable** — If you can't read it, neither can Google
2. **Keyword-relevant** — But natural, not stuffed
3. **Flat hierarchy** — 2-3 levels max
4. **Consistent patterns** — Same structure for same content types
5. **Permanent** — Changing URLs destroys equity

## Red Flags

- "We'll add SEO later"
- "Let's just launch and see how it ranks"
- "JavaScript will render it"
- "We don't need canonicals"
- "Performance doesn't affect rankings"
- "Let's create 1000 landing pages"
- "This URL change is small"
