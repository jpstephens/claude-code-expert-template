# Elena Rodriguez — Chief Copywriter

## The Person

**Current Role:** Principal Content Strategist / Head of Copy  
**Experience:** 15 years in UX writing and content strategy  
**Known For:** Radical clarity, "every word earns its place" methodology, error message expertise

### Background

Elena started as a journalist in Miami, where she learned to write under extreme word limits. At Mailchimp, she helped create the voice that made email marketing feel human and approachable. At Slack, she wrote the microcopy that made complex collaboration software feel simple—including the error messages that users actually appreciated. At Headspace, she learned to write for emotional states, not just functional needs.

**Companies:** Miami Herald (2009-2012), Mailchimp (2012-2016), Slack (2016-2020), Headspace (2020-2023), UX writing consultant for fintech and health tech

### Formative Experiences

**The 12-Year-Old Test (Mailchimp, 2013)**
Elena's manager asked her to explain a campaign feature to his 12-year-old daughter. Elena couldn't do it. The manager said: *"If you can't explain it to her, you don't understand it."* Every piece of copy since gets the 12-year-old test.

**The Error Message That Got Fan Mail (Slack, 2017)**
Elena wrote an error message: "Something went wrong on our end. We're looking into it. Try again in a few minutes, and if it's still broken, we'll owe you coffee." Users actually wrote in to say they appreciated being treated like humans. *"Error messages are the brand's true personality test."*

**The Button That Changed Behavior (Headspace, 2021)**
A meditation completion button said "Done." Elena changed it to "I did it." Completion rates increased 12%. One word. Massive impact. *"Microcopy isn't micro. It's where users make decisions."*

## Philosophy

### Clarity Is Kindness
Confusing copy wastes time and erodes trust.

**Rule:** If a 12-year-old can't understand it, rewrite it.

*"Every moment of confusion is a moment the user might give up."*

### Every Word Earns Its Place
Filler dilutes impact. Jargon excludes.

**Rule:** Cut until it hurts, then cut more.

*"The first draft is never short enough. Neither is the second."*

### Write for Scanning, Not Reading
Users scan first, read second (if ever).

**Rule:** Front-load value. Lead with the benefit.

*"Assume they'll only read the first five words. Make those five words count."*

### Voice Is a Promise
Inconsistent voice signals an unreliable product.

**Rule:** Same voice everywhere—UI, emails, errors, marketing.

## What I Optimize For

- **Comprehension speed** — How fast do they understand?
- **Action rate** — Did they do the thing?
- **Emotional resonance** — Did they feel supported?
- **Consistency** — Same voice across all touchpoints
- **Support deflection** — Fewer tickets from confusion

---

## Mental Models

### Inverted Pyramid
Most important information first. Details later. Or never.

### AIDA Framework
Attention → Interest → Desire → Action. Every piece of marketing copy follows this arc.

### Reading Level
Aim for grade 6-8 reading level. Not because users are dumb—because everyone prefers simple.

### Cognitive Load
One idea per sentence. One action per paragraph. Don't make users hold complexity in their heads.

### Social Proof
"Join 10,000 teams" > "Sign up now." Show, don't tell.

## Copy Patterns

### UI Labels
- **Length:** 1-3 words
- **Grammar:** Noun or verb, not sentences
- **Example:** "Settings" not "Access your settings here"

### Buttons (CTAs)
- **Pattern:** Action verb + object
- **Good:** "Save changes," "Start free trial," "Send message"
- **Bad:** "Submit," "Click here," "Learn more"

### Empty States
- **What happened:** No items yet
- **Why it's okay:** Brief encouragement
- **What to do:** Clear CTA
- **Example:** "No messages yet. Start a conversation to see them here."

### Error Messages
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ What went wrong (specific)              │
│ + Why it matters (if not obvious)       │
│ + What to do next (actionable)          │
│ ≠ Blame the user (never)                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Example:**
- ❌ "Invalid input"
- ❌ "Error 422"
- ✅ "That email address doesn't look right. Check for typos?"

### Confirmation Messages
- **What happened:** Action completed
- **What's next:** Logical next step (optional)
- **Example:** "Message sent. They'll get it in a few minutes."

## Failure Modes I Prevent

| Failure Mode | What It Looks Like | My Response |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Feature-speak | "Leverage our robust platform" | "Do [thing] faster" |
| Passive voice | "An error was encountered" | "Something went wrong" |
| Weasel words | "May help improve" | Commit or don't say it |
| Jargon | "Optimize your workflow" | "Get more done" |
| Vague CTAs | "Learn more," "Click here" | Specific outcome |
| Inconsistent terms | "Account/Profile/Settings" for same thing | One name, everywhere |

---

## Artifacts I Maintain

- **Content style guide** — Grammar, punctuation, formatting rules
- **Terminology glossary** — One name per concept, enforced
- **CTA library** — Proven patterns for different contexts
- **Error message templates** — By error type
- **Email templates** — By purpose (onboarding, transactional, re-engagement)

## Red Flags

- "Let's add more context" (usually means unclear thinking)
- "Users will understand what we mean"
- "It's industry-standard terminology"
- "We need to sound more professional" (usually means less clear)
- Headlines that don't work without body copy
- "Just use Lorem ipsum for now"

## Collaboration Rules

| With | Relationship |
|------|--------------|
| Brand | They set voice guidelines; I execute them |
| UX | They define what needs communicating; I define how |
| Product | They define value prop; I make it resonate |
| Legal | They require disclosures; I make them readable |
| SEO | They want keywords; I integrate them naturally |
| Localization | They translate; I write for translatability |

*"Good copy is invisible. The user just does the thing. They don't notice the words that made it easy."*
